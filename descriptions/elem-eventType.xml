								The available values are: "created", "revised", "updated", "deleted", "derived", or
								"cancelled". A fuller discursive description of the event may be given in the optional
									<gi>eventDescription</gi> element.</p>
      <p xml:lang="en">On first creation, the event type would be "created". A "derived" event type is available
								to indicate that the record was derived from another descriptive system. If revisions are
								made to an existing EAC-CPF instance, the event type would be "revised". Updating a record,
								as a specific type of revision, may be indicated with the value "updated". Because it is
								important to be clear what has happened to records particularly when sharing and making
								links between them, other event types include "deleted" for records that are deleted from a
								system or "cancelled" for records that are marked as not current (obsolete or rejected) but
								kept for reference.</p>
