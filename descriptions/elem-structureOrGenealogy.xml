            <eac-cpf:p>Sir Edward Noel (d 1643) married Julian, daughter and co-heir of Baptists Hicks
										(d 1629), Viscount Campden, and succeeded to the viscouty of Campden and a portion of his
										father-in-law's estates. The third Viscount Campden (1612-82) married Hester Wotton,
										daughter of the second Baron Wotton. The fourth Viscount Campden (1641-1689, created Earl
										of Gainsborough, 1682) married Elizabeth Wriothesley, elder daughter of the fourth Earl of
										Southampton. Jane Noel (d 1811), sister of the fifth and sixth Earls of Gainsborough,
										married Gerard Anne Edwards of Welham Grove (Leicetershire) and had issue Gerard Noel
										Edwards (1759-1838). He married in 1780 Diana Middleton (1762-1823 suo jure Baroness
										Barham), daughter of Charles Middleton (1726-1813), created first Baronet of Barham Court
										(Kent) in 1781 and first Baron Barham in 1805. GN Edwards assumed the surname Noel in 1798
										on inheriting the sixth Earl of Gainborough's Rutland and Gloucestershire estates (though
										not the Earl's honours, which were extinguished); and he later inherited his
										father-in-law's baronetcy. His eldest son John Noel (1781-1866) succeeded to the estates
										of his mother and his father, to his mother's barony and his father's baronetcy, and was
										created Viscount Campden and Earl of Gainsborough in 1841.</eac-cpf:p>
