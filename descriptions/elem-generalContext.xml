            <eac-cpf:p>Edward Koiko Mabo was born in 1936 on the island of Mer, one of the Murray
										Islands, which are located at the eastern extremity of Torres Strait. In June 1992, six
										months after his death, Mabo achieved national prominence as the successful principal
										plaintiff in the landmark High Court ruling on native land title. The High Court ruling,
										for the first time, gave legal recognition to the fact that indigenous land ownership
										existed in Australia before European settlement and that, in some cases, this land tenure
										was not subsequently extinguished by the Crown.</eac-cpf:p>
