      <p xml:lang="en">The <att>localType</att> is broadly available on many descriptive and a
							few control elements. It is intended to provide a means to narrow the semantics of some

							semantically weak. The value of the <att>localType</att> must conform to W3C Schema Part 2:
							Datatypes, anyURI. To facilitate exchange of EAC-CPF instances, it is highly recommend that
							the URI be absolute and resolvable to a local resource that describes the semantic scope and
							use of the value.</p>
